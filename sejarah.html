            <h2>Sejarah Singkat Departemen Fisika FMIPA Unhas</h2>
            
            <p>Department of Physics under the Fakultas Ilmu Pasti dan Ilmu Pengetahuan Alam (FIPPA) which was established on August 17, 1963 in Makassar along with 3 other departments namely: Mathematics, Chemistry and Biology. In the beginning, the Department of Physics had very limited facilities and human resources (HR) so that the Department of Physics was only able to graduate students to the ,Sarjana Muda, level. Furthermore, they completed their undergraduate education at UGM Yogyakarta or ITB Bandung and returned to Unhas to devote themselves as lecturers. This condition lasted until the 1980s. Due to the addition of facilities and the development of human resources and cooperation with several related agencies both public and private, in 1983 the Physics department was able to produce the first Bachelor of Physics (Drs. Piter Rampisela).

During the leadership of Prof. Dr. Achmad Amiruddin as Rector of Unhas, FIPPA including the Department of Physics joined the Faculty of Engineering under the name Faculty of Science and Technology. In 1979, the Physics Department fostered Geology specialization which later became the Geology Department and joined the Faculty of Engineering when in 1983 the Faculty of Science and Technology separated again under the name of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (FMIPA) and the Faculty of Engineering.

In 1983 through the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture No. 0174/0/1983, the Physics Study Program was officially established as part of the Physics Department.

With the increasing number of human resources owned, in 1987 the Department of Physics developed itself by forming several laboratories as a place for the development of science, namely: Theoretical Physics Laboratory, Material and Energy Physics Laboratory, Electronics Laboratory, Optical and Laser Physics Laboratory, Geophysics Laboratory, and Workshop.</p>
